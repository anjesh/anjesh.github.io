<p class="message">
  It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested..... we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of itâ€¦ Life is long if you know how to use it.
